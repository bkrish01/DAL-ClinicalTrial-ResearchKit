                <br>This template is to be used for all studies that require the use of an informed consent form.  Changes are not permitted to the format or context of this template except those specified below.
                <br>Definitions
                <br>ICF Author	Development Clinical Director (DCD), Center for Observational Research (CfOR) Product Lead, Early Development Clinical Research Study Manager (ED CRSM), Site Representative
                Safety Author	Therapeutic Area (TA) Safety, Medical Safety Scientist (MSS)
                <br>
                Introduction
                <br>
                ICF Author must use the current effective version of this template (FORM-001511) to create the first version of ICF Part 1 for a new study only.  Do not start with an ICF from an existing study.  For ongoing studies, the most current approved study-specific ICF Part 1 version is to be amended (ie, do not use this template).
                <br>Note:  This template represents Part 1 of the ICF and contains instructions only for the study-specific ICF language and the product-specific safety language.
                ICF Author do not delete any instructions directed at the Amgen Country Representative.
                <br>Amgen Country Representative appends the country-specific Part 2 language to create the first study-specific, country-specific ICF (United States FORM-050029 or International Law Group FORM-050353 may be used when a country-specific Part 2 is not available).  For ongoing studies, the most current approved country-specific and site-specific ICF are to be amended.
                <br>Note:  Country Part 2 FORMs contain regulatory and legal language for the country.  They may also contain instructions regarding format, style, and changes to Part 1 ICF as required by the country.  Refer to SOP-000739 for a list of country Part 2 FORM numbers.
                <br>Refer to SOP-000739 and MAN-000445 for more information about the process supporting authoring, reviewing, and approving an ICF, including significant changes to sections that may require input from other functions.
                <br>
                <br>General Instructions
                <br>	Italicized text surrounded by << >> is a description of information that should be provided by the author, instructions, or is standard text that should be added based on the protocol.  Delete the <<italicized>> text after pertinent information is incorporated and/or replace it with regular text (no italics, no << >>).
                    <br>	[Bracketed blue bolded] text indicates special instructions to the ICF Author, Safety Author, or Amgen Country Representative.  This text should only be deleted by the role indicated.
                    <br>	Amgen Country Representative must delete all <<italicized>>, [bracketed blue bolded], and instructional text prior to sending the ICF to Regulatory Authorities, IRBs/IECs, and/or Investigators/Study Sites, as applicable.
                        
                        <br>	Black-boxed text indicates special instructions to Amgen Country Representatives and/or Investigators/Study Sites.  ICF Author can delete black-boxed instructions that are not applicable to the study (eg, NAMP).  Otherwise, these instructions should only be deleted by the Amgen Country Representative and/or Investigators/Study Sites.
                        <br>	Standard text (no bolding, no brackets, no italics) can only be changed when necessary and with the agreement of relevant study team members.  Specific sections indicated below require consultation and/or approval.
                        <br>	Text may be changed or removed if it is obviously not relevant to the patient population under study, eg, language relating to pregnancy and lactation would not apply to young pediatric patients.
                        <br>	Each page should minimally include the protocol number, page x of y, and version date.
                        
                        Versioning and Revision Instructions
                        In order to link every site-specific ICF back to its parent Part 1 ICF, the Amgen Global Version number (implemented in FORM-001511 version 5.0) is used.  Amgen Country Representatives must confirm that the Amgen Global Version number is included on every country-specific and site-specific ICF version (in addition to any country and/or site version).
                        
                        Version 1
                        <br>	ICF Author inserts “1” for the initial Part 1 ICF Amgen Global Version (created using this template.
                        <br>	Amgen Country Representative verifies that Amgen Global Version is included on every site ICF.  Note:  A country and/or site version can also be added.  Eg,
                        <br><<Product>>       Page X of Y     <<Country>> Main vX.X dated dd-mmm-yyyy
                            <br>    <<Study No.>>>            		Global Version Main X dated dd-mmm-yyyy
                                <br>        The above information can either be placed in the header or the footer of the ICF, depending on local requirements.
                                <br>
                                <br>            Revisions
                                <br>	ICF Author revises the most current study-specific Part 1 version (ie, does not use this template) and highlights (eg, bolding) changes.  When an addendum is appropriate (based on criteria in MAN-000445), amend the most current study-specific Part 1 version and also create addendum.
                                <br>	ICF Author updates the Amgen Global Version to the next sequential integer (eg, 2, 3).  Note:  Global Version is never a decimal.
                                <br>	Amgen Country Representative creates amendment or addendum based on country/site requirements and/or criteria in MAN-000445.
                                <br>	Amgen Country Representative verifies that the Amgen Global Version number is included on every site ICF (eg, as part of the title or in the header/footer).
                                
                                ICF Author Instructions
                                <br>	Use tables and avoid duplication of language where possible to minimize the number of pages.  Some countries have regulations that limit ICFs to 5 –10 pages.
                                <br>	For observational/non-interventional studies, consult with the Observational Research Review Group (ORRG).
                                <br>	For Phase 0 studies without a challenge agent and for observational/non-interventional studies, delete study drug-specific references and text throughout the template.
                                <br>	The sections of the ICF that are specific to the study and/or Amgen IP must conform to the protocol and to the Investigator Brochure, Development Core Safety Information, Core Data Sheet.
                                <br>	Global Development Studies:  Obtain product-specific contraception and breastfeeding language from the Maternal And Pediatric Regulatory And Safety (MAPRS) group (directly or via link on Safety Operations Product Support (SOPS) portal).  Any changes to current MAPRS guidance on contraception and breastfeeding must be reviewed and approved by MAPRS.
                                <br>	Early Development Studies:  Refer to the Early Development Review Committee regarding current guidance on contraception and breastfeeding.
                                <br>	Obtain the product-specific Risks and Discomforts section from EPIC or via the link on the SOPS portal.   Modify only the study-specific subsections as permitted by instructions to “ICF Author.”  Note:  This may not apply to First In Humans (FIH) studies.
                                <br>	Global Development Studies:  Changes to product-specific Risks and Discomforts language (ie, any language not study-specific and, thus, not containing instructions for ICF Author) must be reviewed and approved by the Global Safety Officer (GSO) and Global Development Leader (GDL).  Summarize changes and document GSO and GDL approval in a Note to File (eg, FORM-000568) to be archived in the Trial Master File.  Reference the Note to File on FORM-017703.
                                <br>	For studies involving third-party collaborator IP, in-vitro diagnostics (IVD), and/or medical devices (collectively referred to as test product[s]), consult with DROC Law or ILG, and, if applicable, the IVD group and the Device Regulatory group.
                                <br>	Replace <<test product(s)>> in the text with the description as used in the protocol (eg, AMG XXX, YYY test).  Note:  When multiple test products are used, some language may need to be repeated, once per test product.
                                    <br>	For studies using devices for IP administration, provide instructions and information in the appropriate section(s) to describe how the device(s) will be used and any potential safety risks and discomforts.
                                    <br>	Create a separate ICF for Future Research testing and for Pharmacogenetic testing, when applicable, using Appendix A.  Each country will determine whether local regulations allow Future Research and/or Pharmacogenetic testing to be combined in one ICF or if separate ICFs are required.
                                    <br>	Create a separate ICF for sub-studies using Appendix A, when applicable.
                                    <br>	Add or insert language from Appendix B, Incapacitated Adult/Child Assent Statement, when applicable.
